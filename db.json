Place the cooked meat mixture into a pie dish.\r\nRoll out the pastry to 5mm/¼in thick and 5cm/2in larger than the dish you are using.\r\nUsing a rolling pin, lift the pastry and place it over the top of the pie dish. Trim and crimp the edges with your fingers and thumb.\r\nBrush the surface with the beaten egg mixture and bake for 30-40 minutes until golden-brown and puffed.\r\nServe with creamy mash and steamed vegetables to soak up the gravy.",
